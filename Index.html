    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Charlie Chalk, a Brainspotting therapist with a passion for helping people recover from trauma, particularly those who have survived narcissistic abuse. My approach is gentle, empathetic, and deeply informed by my own experiences, allowing me to connect on a personal level with my clients.</p>

    <h2>What is Brainspotting?</h2>
    <p>Brainspotting is a powerful, focused treatment method that works by identifying, processing, and releasing core neurophysiological sources of emotional or physical pain, trauma, dissociation, and other challenging symptoms. It harnesses the brain's natural healing abilities by locating and addressing trauma or distress trapped in the brain.</p>
    <p>Brainspotting is particularly effective for trauma survivors because it goes deep into the brain's processes to access and heal trauma at a profound level, without the need for excessive talking. The focus is on finding the "brainspot" that links directly to unresolved trauma.</p>

<section id="background">
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I specialize in working with survivors of narcissistic abuse. For nine years, I was in a relationship with someone who had Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), an experience that deeply affected me and helped shape my current path as a therapist. Understanding the complexities of narcissistic abuse from both a personal and professional perspective allows me to provide compassionate and effective support for survivors.</p>
